# Delhi-AQI-Forecasting-using-Time-Series-Analysis
This project aims to analyze and forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi using both Time Series and Machine Learning models. 
 **Overview**
** Dataset:**  Daily AQI data for Delhi (Attached in file)
**Models Used:**
SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Gradient Boosting with GridSearchCV (Tuned Model)
 **Goal**: Forecast AQI levels and evaluate the performance of different predictive models

** Results**
All models performed well, with Gradient Boosting showing the highest predictive power.
SARIMA effectively modeled seasonal trends in AQI for short-term forecasting.


**Tools & Libraries**
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
statsmodels (SARIMA)
Jupyter Notebook
