## 📌 Overview

- 📅 **Dataset**: Daily AQI data for Delhi (2015–2020)
- 🧠 **Models Used**:
  - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting with GridSearchCV (Tuned Model)
- 🎯 **Goal**: Forecast AQI levels and evaluate the performance of different predictive models
